## Executive Summary

The codebase demonstrates **strong security fundamentals** — cryptographically
secure token generation, parameterised queries, proper cookie flags, WebAuthn
authentication, and structured secrets management. However, several gaps exist
that would block commercial or regulated deployment. These fall into three
categories:

1. **Exploitable vulnerabilities** (fix immediately)
2. **Architectural gaps** (address before going to production)
3. **Compliance/governance gaps** (required for regulated environments)

---

## 1. Exploitable Vulnerabilities

### 1.1 CRITICAL — Timing Attack on API Key Validation

| | |
|---|---|
| **File** | `axon-auth/handler_service_user.go:33` |
| **Code** | `if h.internalAPIKey == "" \|\| apiKey != h.internalAPIKey` |
| **Impact** | Attackers can brute-force the internal API key by measuring response-time deltas |
| **Fix** | Use `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare()` |

The same issue exists in the Cloudflare Worker proxy:

| | |
|---|---|
| **File** | `infra/cloudflare/wire-proxy/src/index.ts:23` |
| **Code** | `token !== env.WIRE_TOKEN` |
| **Fix** | Use `crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual()` |

### 1.2 CRITICAL — Unauthenticated Internal Endpoints

| | |
|---|---|
| **File** | `axon-chat/handler_internal.go:10-30`, `axon-chat/server.go:200-209` |
| **Issue** | `InternalMessagesHandler()` and `InternalAgentHandler()` have **no authentication** — documented as "for internal service-to-service calls" but nothing verifies the caller |
| **Impact** | Any client that can reach the service (SSRF, compromised network, misconfigured firewall) gets full access to all conversations and agent configs |
| **Fix** | Add mTLS, bearer-token validation, or bind to a separate listener on a private interface |

### 1.3 HIGH — Timing Attack on Wire Proxy Token

Already noted in §1.1 — the Cloudflare Worker uses `!==` for token
comparison.

---

## 2. Architectural / Design Gaps

### 2.1 No Rate Limiting on Auth Endpoints

- `axon-auth/handler_login.go`, `handler_register.go`, `handler_service_user.go`
  have no per-IP or per-account rate limiting.
- Aurelia's daemon has a token-bucket limiter (20 req/s sustained, 100 burst)
  but that protects the supervisor API, not the axon HTTP services.
- **Risk**: Credential-stuffing and brute-force attacks against WebAuthn begin/finish.

### 2.2 Session Management Weaknesses

| Gap | Detail |
|-----|--------|
| **No token rotation** | Session tokens are long-lived with no sliding-window refresh or rotation on activity (`axon-auth/`) |
| **365-day service-user sessions** | `axon-auth/server.go:58` — machine tokens live a full year |
| **Cache masks revocation** | `axon/auth.go:167-189` — validated sessions cached for 30 s; a revoked token stays valid until cache expires |
| **Session fixation risk** | WebAuthn ceremony state stored in client-side cookies (`handler_login.go:59-77`); an attacker who pre-sets these cookies can influence the ceremony |

### 2.3 SameSite=Lax (Not Strict)

All session cookies use `SameSite: http.SameSiteLaxMode`. This permits the
cookie to ride along on top-level cross-site navigations, leaving a narrow
CSRF window for state-changing GET endpoints (if any exist).

### 2.4 User Enumeration

`axon-auth/handler_login.go:38-47` returns different error messages for
"user not found" vs "no passkeys registered", allowing attackers to enumerate
valid accounts.

### 2.5 TLS Is Opt-In

`axon/server.go:92-95` falls back to plain HTTP when no TLS config is
provided. All examples (`examples/chat/main.go`, `axon-chat/example/main.go`,
`axon-auth/example/main.go`) use HTTP. Production deployments must enforce TLS
at the reverse-proxy layer (Traefik), but this is not guaranteed by the code.

### 2.6 No CORS Configuration

No CORS headers are set in any axon middleware. This is fine while the SPA is
served from the same origin, but becomes a problem when APIs are consumed by
third-party clients or separate front-ends.

### 2.7 LLM / AI-Specific Risks

| Risk | Status |
|------|--------|
| **Prompt injection** | Tool calls are routed through a validated registry (`axon-loop/run.go:217-231`); unknown tools rejected; panic recovery in place. **Mitigated.** |
| **Tool output re-injection** | Tool results become `RoleTool` messages, not re-injected as system prompts. **Mitigated.** |
| **Agent autonomy limits** | No explicit guardrails on how many tool calls an agent can chain, cost budgets, or human-in-the-loop checkpoints. **Gap.** |
| **Memory poisoning** | `axon-memo` extracts long-term memories from conversations. A crafted prompt could plant false memories that influence future sessions. **Gap.** |

---

## 3. Data Protection & Privacy Gaps

### 3.1 Event Sourcing & Right to Erasure

`axon-fact` stores immutable event streams (`axon-fact/migrations/001_create_events.sql`).
The schema has no DELETE/UPDATE capability — events are append-only with a
`(stream, sequence)` primary key and JSONB `data`/`metadata` columns. Neither
`axon-fact` nor any other module implements `DeleteEvent()`, `AnonymizeEvent()`,
or `PurgeStream()`.

Under GDPR Article 17 (right to erasure) and CCPA, you must be able to delete
or anonymise personal data on request. An append-only event store with no
crypto-shredding or tombstone mechanism makes this extremely difficult.

**Fix**: Add `AnonymizeStream()` to the `EventStore` interface, or implement
crypto-shredding (encrypt PII with per-user keys; destroy the key to "erase").

### 3.2 PII in Long-Term Memory

`axon-memo/extractor.go:127-178` builds extraction prompts that include full
conversation history, timestamps, roles, and the agent's system prompt. The
extracted memories — including emotional state analysis, relationship trust
metrics (ability/benevolence/integrity scores), and raw conversation text —
are stored as immutable events via `axon-fact`:

```go
// axon-memo/extractor.go:220
emit(ctx, e.eventStore, stream, MemoryExtracted{
    MemoryID, ConversationID, AgentSlug, UserID,
    MemoryType, Content, Importance,
})
```

There is no:

- Classification of stored memories by sensitivity
- Retention policy or automatic expiry
- Mechanism to enumerate and delete a user's memories on request
- Encryption of memory content at rest

### 3.3 Financial Data (axon-book)

Double-entry bookkeeping backed by event sourcing. For PCI-DSS or financial
regulation, journal entries containing account numbers or transaction details
need encryption at rest and field-level access controls — neither is present.

### 3.4 Logging & Sensitive Data Leakage

Structured logging via `slog` is used throughout. The analysis did not find
secrets being logged, but there is no systematic **log scrubbing** or
**redaction framework** to prevent accidental PII/token leakage as the
codebase grows.

### 3.5 NATS Transport Security

`axon-nats/eventbus.go` accepts a `*nats.Conn` with no TLS configuration in the
wrapper. Transport security depends entirely on the caller configuring TLS on
the NATS connection. No documentation guides operators on the required NATS
security setup.

### 3.6 Deploy Gate Bypass Risk

`axon-gate/handler.go:164` — username-based access control skips the check if
either the approval's `Username` or the session's username is empty:

```go
if username != "" && approval.Username != "" && username != approval.Username {
    // reject
}
```

An approval created without a `Username` field can be approved by any
authenticated user. This is by design (allows "any authenticated user"
fallback) but needs explicit documentation and should be opt-in for
security-sensitive deployments.

Additionally, approval decisions are not written to an immutable audit log —
only errors are logged via `slog`.

### 3.7 No Backup / Disaster Recovery Evidence

No backup configuration, snapshot strategy, or recovery runbook was found in
the codebase or infrastructure configuration.

## 4. Supply Chain & Dependency Security

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Dependencies pinned to exact versions | Yes — all `go.mod` files |
| `go.sum` integrity hashes present | Yes |
| No `replace` directives | Confirmed |
| No deprecated crypto libraries | Confirmed (`golang.org/x/crypto v0.43.0`) |
| GOPRIVATE set for `github.com/benaskins/*` | Yes — bypasses sum DB cache |
| SCA / vulnerability scanning | **Not present** — no `govulncheck`, Dependabot, or Snyk |
| SBOM generation | **Not present** |

---

## 5. What You Need for Commercialisation / Regulated Environments

### 5.1 Immediate Fixes (Pre-Production)

| # | Action | Effort |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | Constant-time comparison for all token/key checks | Small |
| 2 | Authenticate internal service-to-service endpoints (mTLS or bearer tokens) | Medium |
| 3 | Add rate limiting middleware to auth and API endpoints | Medium |
| 4 | Implement session token rotation / sliding expiry | Medium |
| 5 | Unify auth error messages to prevent user enumeration | Small |
| 6 | Enforce TLS-only at the application level (reject plain HTTP in production mode) | Small |

### 5.2 Compliance Framework Requirements

- [ ] **Minimum necessary** — limit PHI exposure to what each service needs

### 5.3 Engineering Infrastructure

| Capability | Current State | Required |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Vulnerability scanning** | None | `govulncheck` in CI, Dependabot/Snyk for deps |
| **SBOM** | None | Generate CycloneDX/SPDX on every release |

| **Uptime monitoring** | Health checks in aurelia | External uptime monitoring (e.g., Grafana synthetic) |

### 5.4 AI-Specific Governance

For commercial LLM-powered products, regulators (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF) increasingly require:

- [ ] **Model card / AI transparency** — document which models are used, for what purpose
- [ ] **Human-in-the-loop** — configurable checkpoints where a human must approve agent actions
- [ ] **Cost / token budgets** — prevent runaway LLM spend from unbounded tool-call loops
- [ ] **Output filtering** — content safety filters on LLM responses before delivery to users
- [ ] **Bias & fairness testing** — if the system makes decisions affecting users
- [ ] **AI incident reporting** — process for logging and reporting AI system failures
- [ ] **Memory audit** — ability to review and correct stored memories (axon-memo)

## 7. Positive Security Properties

The following are already well-implemented:

- **Token generation**: `crypto/rand` with 256-bit entropy, SHA-256 hashed storage
- **WebAuthn**: Mature `go-webauthn` library, proper credential validation
- **Cookie security**: `HttpOnly`, `Secure` (configurable), `SameSite=Lax`
- **Request body limits**: 1 MB caps on auth and chat endpoints
- **Path traversal protection**: Workspace-root boundary validation in lamina CLI
- **Secrets management**: OpenBao (Vault) with macOS Keychain fallback, audit logging
- **Structured logging**: `slog` throughout with consistent field patterns
- **Wire proxy**: HTTPS enforced for non-localhost, token authentication
- **Dependency hygiene**: Exact version pins, go.sum integrity, no replace directives
- **Process supervision**: Aurelia validates service specs, rate-limits its API, uses 0700 permissions
- **Process isolation**: Native driver uses `Setpgid: true` for process group isolation; commands split on whitespace (no shell interpolation)
- **Deploy gate**: Two-factor approval (random token + session identity), constant-time token comparison, time-limited grants, idempotent resolution
- **Audit trail**: Aurelia maintains append-only audit log at `~/.aurelia/audit.log` (NDJSON, 0600 perms) covering all secret operations
- **Analytics logging**: `axon-chat/analytics.go` logs only semantic events (token counts, duration) — no message content
- **Error handling**: Generic errors returned to HTTP clients; detailed errors logged server-side only
- **Input validation**: Version strings validated against semver regex; injection attempts tested (`v1.0.0; rm -rf /`)
