# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

Lamina is a **git repository** that serves as the workspace root for a personal compute cluster running on a Mac Studio (Apple Silicon). It contains:

1. The **`lamina` CLI** (`cmd/lamina/`) — a workspace management tool for coordinating across sub-repos
2. **Claude Code skills** (`skills/`) — embedded skill definitions for workspace operations
3. **Applications** (`apps/`) — workspace apps built on axon modules (imago, revue, valuer, vita)

The workspace is populated by `lamina init`, which clones all sub-repos into this directory. Each sub-repo has its own `.git` and is pushed to GitHub separately (gitignored here).

### Sub-repos (independent git repos, cloned by `lamina init`)

| Repo | Purpose |

| **axon-look** | Analytics event ingestion and querying backed by ClickHouse |
| **axon-loop** | Provider-agnostic conversation loop for LLM-powered agents |

| **axon-scan** | Code quality pipeline: static analysis, security scanning, test execution, attestation |
| **axon-sign** | Cryptographic signing: Ed25519 keypairs, SSHSIG signatures, key rotation, provenance |
| **axon-snip** | Code assembly engine: PRD analysis, module selection, scaffold generation |
| **axon-synd** | Syndication engine: publish to static site, syndicate to Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads |
| **axon-talk** | LLM provider adapters for axon-loop (OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic) |
| **axon-tape** | Buffered token stream filter: pluggable matchers, content safety, PII redaction |
| **axon-task** | Generic async task runner with pluggable workers |
| **axon-tool** | Tool definition and execution primitives for LLM agents |
| **axon-wire** | HTTP transport routing outbound requests through a Cloudflare Worker proxy |

Each sub-repo has its own `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`. When working in a sub-repo, read its project-level docs first.

## Three-layer Architecture

```
lamina (at rest)                    aurelia (in flight)
 │                                   │
 ├── repo status, deps, testing      ├── process supervision

              axon (building material)
```

- **lamina** manages the workspace as source: repo status, dependency graphs, testing, releases
- **aurelia** supervises the system in flight: process lifecycle, health checks, service dependencies
- **axon** is the building material: a suite of Go libraries you assemble services from

```bash
lamina init                     # Clone all workspace repos
lamina repo                     # Summary table of all sub-repos
lamina repo status              # Full git status for every sub-repo
lamina repo fetch               # Git fetch all sub-repos
lamina repo <name> push         # Git push a specific sub-repo
lamina repo push --all          # Git push all repos (--all required)
lamina repo rebase --all        # Git pull --rebase all repos

lamina deps                     # Show dependency graph between workspace modules
lamina test                     # Run go test ./... across all axon-* modules

lamina eval plans/smoke.yaml    # Run a YAML evaluation plan against the cluster

## Planning

- Plan steps should be commit-sized — each step produces one testable, committable change

## Conventions

- **Task runner**: `just` (justfile) in lamina and aurelia; standard `go` tooling in axon-* modules
- **Internal domain**: `*.hestia.internal` / `*.limen.internal` (not `.local`)
- **Native services**: Go binaries compiled for darwin/arm64, embed SvelteKit UIs via `//go:embed`
- **Containerized services**: Run on OrbStack (postgres, grafana, loki, traefik, vault, etc.)
- **AI agent docs**: Each project has `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` with full architecture docs for any AI coding agent
- **Module publishing**: All axon-* modules are public on GitHub under MIT license, resolved via Go module proxy
- **GOPRIVATE**: `github.com/benaskins/*` is set in go env to bypass sum DB cache delays
- **No Python**: deliberate choice — stack is Go + Swift (MLX) + TypeScript (SvelteKit)
- **Slop guard**: `slop-guard` runs as pre-commit hook and Claude Code post-tool-use hook
