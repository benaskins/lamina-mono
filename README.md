# Lamina

A modular Go toolkit for building LLM-powered services.

Lamina is a collection of open-source libraries that provide the building blocks for AI agent infrastructure: conversation loops, tool execution, memory, authentication, analytics, evaluation, and deployment.

## Libraries

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [axon](https://github.com/benaskins/axon) | Shared toolkit for AI-powered web services — server lifecycle, auth, database, metrics, SSE, stream filtering |
| [axon-loop](https://github.com/benaskins/axon-loop) | Provider-agnostic conversation loop for LLM-powered agents |
| [axon-tool](https://github.com/benaskins/axon-tool) | Tool definition and execution primitives for LLM agents |
| [axon-memo](https://github.com/benaskins/axon-memo) | Long-term memory extraction and consolidation for LLM agents |
| [axon-chat](https://github.com/benaskins/axon-chat) | Chat service with LLM integration, tool calling, SSE streaming, and agent management |
| [axon-auth](https://github.com/benaskins/axon-auth) | WebAuthn-based authentication with passkey registration, login, and session management |
| [axon-eval](https://github.com/benaskins/axon-eval) | Evaluation framework for running scenario plans against a live service cluster |
| [axon-look](https://github.com/benaskins/axon-look) | Analytics event ingestion and querying backed by ClickHouse |
| [axon-gate](https://github.com/benaskins/axon-gate) | Deploy approval gate with Signal notifications and a review UI |
| [axon-task](https://github.com/benaskins/axon-task) | Asynchronous task runner for Claude Code sessions and image generation |

## How they fit together

```
axon-tool ─── tool definitions
    │
axon-loop ─── conversation loop (uses axon-tool)
    │
axon-chat ─── chat service (uses axon-loop, axon-tool, axon)
    │
axon-memo ─── long-term memory (uses axon)
axon-auth ─── authentication (uses axon)
axon-look ─── analytics (uses axon)
axon-gate ─── deploy gate (uses axon)
axon-task ─── task runner (uses axon)
axon-eval ─── evaluation (standalone)
```

`axon` provides the foundation: HTTP server lifecycle, auth middleware, database helpers, Prometheus metrics, and SSE streaming. The other libraries build on it for specific capabilities.

## Lamina CLI

The `lamina` command manages the workspace — running tests across modules, checking repo status, executing evaluation plans, and coordinating dependencies.

```bash
lamina repo                     # Summary table of all sub-repos
lamina repo status              # Git status across every sub-repo
lamina test                     # Run go test ./... across all modules
lamina test axon-chat           # Test a specific module
lamina eval plans/smoke.yaml    # Run an evaluation plan against the cluster
lamina deps                     # Show dependency graph between modules
```

## Install

Each library is a standalone Go module:

```
go get github.com/benaskins/axon@latest
go get github.com/benaskins/axon-loop@latest
go get github.com/benaskins/axon-memo@latest
```

Requires Go 1.24+.

## A note on how this was built

Lamina was designed by Ben Askins and built in collaboration with Claude,
Anthropic's AI assistant. The architecture, taste, and decisions are human.
The typing is fast.
